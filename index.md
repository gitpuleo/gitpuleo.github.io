<p>Hi there, and thanks for visiting my portfolio site. I am a lifelong, interdisciplinary learner chasing as many threads as time and attention will allow. My journey to tech was a decade long associational leap from one domain to the next:<p>

<p class="blockquote" style="font-style: italic;"> Writing -> Linguistics -> ESL Education -> Sociology & Anthropology -> Development Economics and Political Economy -> Quantitative & Qaulitative Research -> Software Development & Data Analysis.<p> 

<p>I'm excited to pursue a career where continuous learning is prioritized and cross-domain knowledge valued.<p>
