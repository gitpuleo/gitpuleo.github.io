<p>Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio site. I am a lifelong interdisciplinary learner chasing as many threads as time and attention will allow. I collect ideas with the obsession others reserve for stamps or coins. My journey to tech was a decade long associational leap from one domain to the next that traces a path through increasing complexity.<p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> Writing -> Linguistics -> ESL Education -> Sociology & Anthropology -> Economics and Political Economy -> Quantitative & Qaulitative Research -> Software Development & Data Analysis.<p> 

<p>Looking for a career where continuous learning is prioritized and cross-domain knowledge valued.<p>



brief summary of who you are, what you can do (including new tech skills), and what you are seeking for your career
